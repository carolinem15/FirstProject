It's Raining Playlists!

# Description

"It's Raining Playlists!" generates playlists based off of parameters set by the user. Once the parameters are set for the playlist, the application generates songs to fill the playlist based off of the userâ€™s criteria. Parameters include genre, start and end year, and up to 3 artists. Once the playlist is formed, a picture associated with the theme of the playlist is included. 

The purpose of this application is to seamlessly incorporate the concepts of web design and development we have learned so far. This project offers an opportunity to work on a project as a group in a way that mimics professional project work. We used GitHub projects to facilitate project discussion and progress.

In the future, this application will also enable you to adjust the total length of the playlist, enter a sleep timer for the playlist, and include a shuffle function. 

## Installation

To install our project, click the URL to open the page, and your first stop will be the application homepage. This application has a mobile responsive design and also renders well on tablets.

## Usage

The main homepage will contain designated fields to enter your playlist criteria. You have the option to enter genre, a date range, and up to 3 artists to inspire your playlist. After you are finished, click the green "create playlist" buttom at the bottom of the page and watch as your playlist is generated underneath the button. In the navigation bar at the top of the page, there is another page available where you can enter a specific song in your playlist into a field and lyrics will display after hitting submit. Additionally, an "about us" page is available in the navigation bar. This page contains information about the developers behind this project.
